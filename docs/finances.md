# Finances

## Tuition

Tuition for the program must be paid upfront. I do not accept any other form of split payment, income sharing, scholarships, etc.

| Option  | Description  | Price |
|---|---|---|
| Pay upfront | Pay full tuition upfront by first day of class | TBD - pending research |

## Refunds

I want you to be confident you chose the right program. If you leave in the first week, you will be refunded your entire tuition payment, minus an administrative fee.

If you leave anytime after that, you will be refunded a prorated amount.
