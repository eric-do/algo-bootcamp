# FAQ

## Why is the program so expensive?

The most reputable bootcamps charge ~$18,000 for 12 weeks. For 4 weeks, that price would be $4,500. To me, this program is at a discount ðŸ™Œ

What experience do I have to back that up?

I taught at Hack Reactor for many years and advanced the lecturing style there. I bring with me the best of the program, along with my own optimizations in teaching working mental models, which I'm absolutely obsessed about.

My students have graduated and gotten jobs at Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, Facebook, Apple, and many more great companies ðŸ™Œ

My program is intensive, and I stand by the value I provide. If you have any doubts, please reach out or read my student reviews ðŸ™‚

## Why do this program when there are many cheaper options?

I'll be honest with you. If you are rigorous with your study plan and can commit to your grind, you can:
- Grind Leetcode / AlgoExpert
- Schedule interview practice on Pramp
- Network on LinkedIn

If you're coming from a bootcamp, you probably remember thinking to yourself at points before joining, "I can teach myself to code". You may have thought that to yourself many times over many years before joining ðŸ™‚

My program effective for the same reason any other high quality bootcamps are effective. My program is about accountability and constant intensive learning. It's also about frequent exposure to interview environments, so you don't freeze up when you do have your interviews.
