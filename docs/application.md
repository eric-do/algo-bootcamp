# Application process

## Assessment
Upon submission of your request to enroll, we will send you a CodeSignal prompt for basic assessment of fundamental coding concepts. This should take you no longer than an hour.

Your submission of the assessment should be done no later than 1 week before the start of the cohort.

You may be asked to fix your code as condition of joining the cohort.

We expect to see:
- Good coding practices, including variable and function names
- Basic tests (console logs showing edge cases are fine)

## Enrollment confirmation
Your enrollment will be confirmed via email by Friday before the first day of the cohort.
