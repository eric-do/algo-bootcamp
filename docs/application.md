# Application process

## Assessment

Upon submission of your request to enroll, I will send you a coding challenge for basic assessment of fundamental coding concepts. This should take you no longer than an hour.

Your submission of the assessment should be done no later than 1 week before the start of the cohort.

You may be asked to fix your code as a condition of joining the cohort.

I expect to see:
- Modular and reusable functions
- Clear variable names
- Attention to detail and styling

## Enrollment confirmation

Your enrollment will be confirmed via email by Friday before the first day of the cohort.
