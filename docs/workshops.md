# Workshops and office hours

We also do workshops and office hours on a variety of topics, separate from the bootcamp. The topics are not limited to algorithms. Availability is dependent on instructor schedules.

Office hours are charged per person. Workshops are a flat fee up to 10 people.

| Name  |  Duration  | Price | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Office hours  | 1 hour | $50/hr | Go over topic of choice |
| React workshop  | 1-2 days | $500/day | Fundamentals of React |
| Fullstack workshop  | 2 days | $500/day | Fundamentals of fullstack development |


## Office hours

Office hour topics should be specific as possible. Instructors may need time to prepare materials.

Office hours are limited to one person at a time, and pricing is by the hour.

## Workshops

Workshops are 1-2 day sessions. Typically the first day will be spent lecturing and coding in a group. The second day will mostly be less lecturing, but continues with live assistance on bug fixes and mental models.

Workshops can be done in groups of up to 10, and pricing is by the day.

### React fundamentals

This workshop is intended for those who are new to React. Some experience with HTML and Javascript is required. Students are expected to have some understanding of closures, callbacks, `this`.

We will cover fundamentals, including:
- Thinking in React
- Mentally modeling data flows
- Designing and implementing a simple React app

### Fullstack fundamentals

This stack is focused on React, Node, Express, and MySQL.

There is a lot to cover in this workshop, even with basic knowledge of the stack. Students should at minimum be able to:
- Render a list in React
- Write basic read/write/update/delete queries in SQL
- Identify callback functions and walk through code with callbacks
