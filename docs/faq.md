# FAQ

## Why do Algo Camp when there are many cheaper options?

I'll be honest with you. If you are rigorous with your study plan and can commit to your grind, you can:
- Grind Leetcode / AlgoExpert
- Schedule interview practice on Pramp
- Network on LinkedIn

This may have good results for you, and if you're up to it, I'm not going to discourage it üëç

My program is effective for the same reason any other high quality bootcamps are effective. My program is about accountability and constant intensive learning. It's also about frequent exposure to interview environments, so you don't freeze up when you do have your interviews.

If you have been through a bootcamp and are astounded by how much progress you made in 3 months, you'll understand what we are looking to achieve here.
