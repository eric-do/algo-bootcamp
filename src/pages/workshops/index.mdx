# Workshops and office hours

I do workshops and office hours on a variety of topics, separate from the bootcamp. These are great options for those with limited time and clear goals, for example:
- Companies that want their employees to quickly learn React
- Individuals wanting to address specific gaps in preparation for interviews

Office hours are charged per person. Workshops have a flat fee with a 10 attendee limit.

| Name  |  Duration  | Price | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Office hours  | 1 hour | $50/hr | Go over topic of choice |
| React workshop  | 1-2 days | $500/day | Fundamentals of React |
| Fullstack workshop  | 2 days | $500/day | Fundamentals of fullstack development |

## Office hours

Office hour topics should be specific as possible. I may need time to prepare materials.

Office hours are limited to one person at a time, and pricing is by the hour. The suggested topics below are not exhaustive ðŸ™‚

## Workshops

Workshops are 1-2 day sessions that include lectures, group coding, and solo coding. I will be there all day to provide feedback and unblock students.

Workshops can be done in groups of up to 10, and pricing is by the day.

### React fundamentals

This workshop is intended for those who are new to React. Some experience with HTML and Javascript is required. Students should have some understanding of AJAX requests, callbacks, and ES6 classes.

We will cover fundamentals, including:
- Thinking in React
- Mentally modeling data flows
- Designing and implementing a simple React app

### Fullstack fundamentals

This stack is focused on React, Node, Express, and MySQL.

There is a lot to cover in this workshop, even with basic knowledge of the stack. Students should at minimum be able to:
- Render a list of components in React
- Write basic read/write/update/delete queries in SQL
- Identify callback functions and walk through code with callbacks
